POKEMON

A tool that will check facebook at dynamic intervals for pokes and respond with rutheless efficiancy.

Before you run, you need to create a config file. The contents of which will look like this:

<code>
module PokemonConfig

  USERNAME = "myemail@address.com"
  PASSWORD = "mypassword"

#min and max wait time in seconds
  MAX_WAIT = 30*60
  MIN_WAIT = 1

end
</code>

Then running is as simple as:

ruby pokemon.rb
